If u wanna check it, soooo good luck.

If you still there then it's use Cloud PostgreSQL so u musnt connect yours database just open in IDEA and run like simple django project(dont forget about dependensice)

After statr you will see THE VOID, joke just 404. Add "/admin/" to use Django administration (Login = "admin" password = "admin" P.S.: My dad shoose this psw). 
Also add "/api/" to get login page(thera are some users like User1 - User1; User2-User2). The home page will be different for Employees and Company users. To create employee just press registration(Tarasana - Tarasana already exist). 
To create Company user, soo everything is more complicated here, you should use "/api/router/" and make it by yourself. BTW User1 - User1 ... are Company users.

When you login as Company you can see your restaurant list, u also can add day menu for any of them (one for a day) and u can create a new restaurant by yourself cool right? 

If u enter like employee u can see Menus and they rating and also vote for one of them (u can vote hom much u want so have fun)

Thx for your atention I hope I cheered you up a bit.
